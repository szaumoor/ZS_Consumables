# ZS_Consumables

## Introduction

This provides a variety of consumable items for use in the game, enhancing gameplay and offering new strategies for players. Many are taken or inspired by other games and media such as BG3, NWN, and The Witcher. The mod distributes the items among vanilla stores as well as manually placed on some NPCs and automatically in the loot of some enemies randomly.

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with everything as far as I know. Please offer feedback on balance and the supply of oils throughout the game if you try this. One caveat to mention is that it might be philosophically incompatible with other mods. For example, it might add bonuses that add up to too much if you have mods that give you insane bonuses already; or you might have a mod that also introduces "oils" or some such items, which would interfere in the sense that it would stack with my oils, when they shouldn't, as far as my design decisions.

## Known issues

The noxious oil sometimes seems to not offer log feedback indicating whether the poisoning was resisted or not. I don't think it affects functionality though.

Additionally, applying the oils through the inventory will be through a button that states "drink potion", which doesn't make sense (trust me, don't drink them for real, you'll die), but I don't think that can be helped.

## Feedback & Future plans

If you have any ideas as to what things to add as a consumable, let me know! If I like it, I might add it, as long as it seems appropriate for the setting.

Let me know also of any bugs, and any other mods that might require compatibility with, and I'll see what I can do.
