## Fixes

- Fixed Dragon Bile oil inappropriately stacking with itself

## Modifications

- For balance, a specific target cannot be hit by a specific oil (no matter the source) more than three times every round. This means that a fighter with 7-9 APR when using Improved Haste, or 10 APR when using whirlwind, can't hit them more than what is allowed. In order to maximize damage output from different party members, they should use different oils each, if desired.
