## Fixes

- Fixed incorrect store addition code resulting in empty entries added to some stores instead of the intended items
- Fixed NPCs using my items unintelligently because of the gpuse script
- Fixed prices of Angelic Reprieve and Slumber being swapped by default in the config (Slumber is supposed to be more expensive)
